FOWTextureSize Mismatch Analysis
Based on the code examination, here's what happens when the FOVManager's FOWTextureSize doesn't match the editor's baked FOV map dimensions:
The Problem:
FOVManager creates a RenderTexture with size FOWTextureSize × FOWTextureSize (line 148)
FOVMapGenerator creates a Texture2DArray with dimensions FOVMapWidth × FOVMapHeight (line 250)
Agent visibility calculation uses FOWTextureSize to convert world coordinates to UV coordinates (lines 358-361)
What Happens with Mismatch:
Case 1: FOWTextureSize > FOVMap dimensions
The runtime FOW texture is larger than the baked FOV map
Result: The FOV map gets stretched/upsampled when sampled by the shader
Visual: Blurry/less precise obstacle detection, but no crashes
Case 2: FOWTextureSize < FOVMap dimensions
The runtime FOW texture is smaller than the baked FOV map
Result: The FOV map gets downsampled when sampled by the shader
Visual: Loss of detail, potential aliasing, but still functional
Case 3: Agent visibility calculation mismatch
The agentUV *= FOWTextureSize calculation (line 361) assumes the FOW texture size
If this doesn't match the actual FOV map resolution, agent visibility sampling will be incorrect
Result: Agents may appear/disappear at wrong locations relative to obstacles
The Real Issue:
The most critical problem is that agent visibility sampling coordinates are calculated using FOWTextureSize, but the actual FOV map may have different dimensions. This means:
Agent visibility checks will sample the wrong pixels in the FOV map
Agents may be visible when they should be hidden (or vice versa)
The mismatch creates a coordinate system misalignment
Recommendation:
The system should either:
Enforce matching sizes - Add validation to ensure FOWTextureSize matches the FOV map dimensions
Use FOV map dimensions - Calculate agent UV coordinates based on the actual FOV map size rather than FOWTextureSize
Add a scaling factor - Account for the size difference in the UV coordinate calculation
